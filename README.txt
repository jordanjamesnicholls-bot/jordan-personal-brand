Sushi Catch — Mini Game

How to use:
1) Add `sushi-catch.html` to your site repo (same level as `index.html`).
2) Commit to `main` — Netlify auto-publishes.
3) Link to it from your homepage:
   <a href="sushi-catch.html" class="btn small">Play Sushi Catch</a>

Customize inside the <script>:
- Difficulty: change spawnInterval (lower is harder) and plate.speed.
- Reset high score: clear localStorage.sushi_best in your browser console.
